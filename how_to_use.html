And when it comes to tasks such as calculating the critical path, probabilities, elaborating a PERT chart, and crashing projects, we may not even have time to eat. But what if you had access to an application to help you solve these types of exercises? Then you would have more time to dedicate to you and your loved ones. In this article we will explain everything about our critical path method calculator, and PERT CPM diagram online."</blockquote></a>
      <h1 class="use-heading">Instructions:</h1>
      <div class="instruction-div">
        <ul>
          <li>You may enter any numerical value including integers and floats.</li>
          <li>Even though it is possible to enter negative values for duration, you shouldn't enter them or it will break the program and your output will have side-effects.</li>
          <li>I know the graph feels janky but thats all I could do in 3 days. And no, it wasn't by choice. It was just convinience.</li>
          <li>If anyone thinks they can improve anything on this software, you can contact admin.</li>
          <li>You can even help me improve on design if you have got time ;)</li>
          <li style="color: red">Important: A is the starting node, it shouldn't have any dependence and technically no duration. There has to be atleast one activity which is dependent on A, or else the graph won't plot. If any activity has no dependency, instead of leaving it blank or '-', just type 'A' instead.</li>
